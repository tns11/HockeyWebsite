<FONT COLOR="#800080">The Hockey Champions Trophy (HCT) is an international field hockey tournament held by the International Hockey Federation (IHF). Founded in 1978 by Pakistan's Air Marshal Nur Khan and the Pakistan Hockey Federation, it features the world's top-ranked field hockey teams competing in a round robin format. A biennial women's tournament was added in 1987. The Champions Trophy was changed from an annual to a biennial event from 2014 onwards, due to the introduction of the Hockey World League (HWL). The 2018 edition will be the last edition of the Champions Trophy and the tournament will be replaced by the Hockey Pro League (HPL) in 2019.[1]
In the women's tournament six teams all play each other to decide the winner. These teams are England, New Zealand, Australia, Netherlands, Argentina and the USA. In 2016, the tournament was held at Lee Valley in London, and started on Saturday 18 June 2016.
In the men's tournament, the Australians have won the trophy fourteen, the Germans ten, and the Dutch eight times. Pakistan is the only Asian champion, with three titles to its name including the first two in 1978 and 1980. In the women's tournament the Netherlands and Australia have won the trophy six times. Argentina have won the trophy seven times, while Germany, China and South Korea have won it once.
Since the 2011 edition, eight teams of each sex have qualified for the championship. The first edition had five teams, the second had seven, 1987 had eight, and all other editions through 2010 had six. In the year following the Olympics or a World Cup, the participating teams include the host, the defending champion, the world champion and the next highest ranked teams from either the most recent World Cup or Olympic Games.
The last placed team in the tournament is dropped and replaced by the winner of the Champions Challenge, which was introduced in 2001 and can be considered as the Champions Trophy for so called B-nations.
